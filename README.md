# Macro Data Refinement

## "The work is mysterious and important."

Welcome to **Macro Data Refinement**, a browser-based game inspired by the enigmatic work performed by the employees of Lumon Industries in the critically acclaimed TV show "Severance."

In the shadowy depths of Lumon's severed floor, employees spend their days refining numbers - a task whose purpose remains shrouded in mystery. They sort cryptic numerical sequences into five bins according to the Four Tempers: Woe, Frolic, Dread, and Malice. What these numbers mean and why this work must be done, no one truly knows.

This game captures the essence of that peculiar work while transforming it into an engaging puzzle experience. As a Macro Data Refiner, you'll sort numbers into bins, watch your progress bars fill, and perhaps feel that same uncanny satisfaction that keeps Mark, Irving, Dylan, and Helly returning to their desks each day.

## Game Features

- **Five Data Bins**: Fill Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon bins to achieve 100% completion
- **Mysterious Number Sorting**: Click on numbers to send them flying into bins, with proximity detection for chain reactions
- **Highlighted Numbers**: Catch the special glowing numbers for 50x bin filling power
- **Power-Ups**: Discover and activate special power-ups that appear randomly
- **Difficulty Settings**: Choose your challenge level, affecting how long the valuable highlighted numbers remain visible
- **Progress Tracking**: Watch as individual bins and your total progress increase toward completion
- **One-Shot Fill Option**: Each bin has a special instant-fill option that can be used once

## "Please enjoy all numbers equally."

Unlike Lumon's employees, you're free to leave at any time - no need for the "Break Room." But we suspect you'll want to stay until you've refined all that mysterious data.

*Remember: The work is important. You're happy here.*
